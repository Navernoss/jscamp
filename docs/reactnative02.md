import YouTube from 'react-youtube'

## Text

We've already seen this [React component](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text) for displaying text. `Text` supports nesting, styling and touch processing.

## Image

[React Component](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image) for displaying various types of images, including network images, static resources, temporary local images, and images from local disk.

```SnackPlayer name=index.js
import * as React from 'react'
import { Image } from 'react-native'

const App = () => (
  <Image style={{ width: 100, height: 100 }}
    source={{
      uri: 'https://reactnative.dev/img/tiny_logo.png',
    }}
  />
)

export default App
```

The height and width of a component determine its size on the screen. There are three ways to work with sizes: fixed sizes, flexible sizes, percentage sizes. More details about them [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/height-and-width).
