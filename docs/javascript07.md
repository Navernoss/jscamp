There are two 2Ô∏è‚É£ types of numbers in modern JavaScript:

### `number`

Ordinary numbers in JavaScript are stored in the 64-bit IEEE-754 format, also called double precision floating point numbers. These are the numbers we will use most often. Integers are not considered a separate type of numbers. In addition to floating point numbers, the numeric data type also includes three character values: `Infinity`,` -Infinity`, and `NaN` (non-number).

### `bigInt`

Numbers make it possible to work with integers of arbitrary length. They are rarely needed and are used in cases where you need to work with values ‚Äã‚Äãoutside the maximum safe integer value `Number`.

Any number, even a decimal fraction with a lot of decimal places, is never quoted.

You can use four types of numeric literals: decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal. Since the last three are used quite rarely, we will omit their detailed description üñäÔ∏è, but the curious can get acquainted with them [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Numbers_and_dates).

:::caution
Be careful when using leading zeros! This means you don't need to put zero before the decimal number.

```jsx
1234567890
42

0888 // 888 is treated as decimal
0777 // treated as non-strict octal (511 decimal)
```
