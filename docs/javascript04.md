## Dynamic typing

JavaScript is a loosely typed or dynamic language. This means that you do not need to define the type of the variable 🔔 in advance.

![Dinamics](https://media.giphy.com/media/26uf759LlDftqZNVm/giphy.gif)

The type will be determined automatically during program execution. It also means that you can use one variable 🔔 to store 📦 different types of data 👇:

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  let foo = 42 // now foo is of type number
  foo = 'bar' //and now foo is of type string
  return typeof foo
}
```

## typeof

In order to understand the data type contained in a variable, the `typeof` operator is used. The `typeof` operator returns the type of the argument.
It has two syntaxes, with brackets and without:

- Operator syntax: `typeof x`

- Function syntax: `typeof (x)`

They work the same, but the first syntax is shorter.

The result of `typeof` is a string containing the type.

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  let num = 9
  return typeof num
}
```

## Data types

The JavaScript standard defines 9 data types. Get to know each of them by outputting to the console and then I will tell you about each of them in more detail.

```javascript
let one = { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Smith' } // object

let two = () => {} // function

let three = 'bar' // string

let four = 42 // number

let five = 19241924124n // bigint

let six = true // boolean

let seven = null // null

let eight // undefined

let nine = Symbol() // symbol
```
