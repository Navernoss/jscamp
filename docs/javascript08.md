There will be a lot of new things in this chapter, but it shouldn't be very difficult: after all, in general, everything revolves around a simple idea - true or false?

Until now, we have always dealt only with primitive data types - with numbers and strings.
Have you come across the term "primitive" in programming before? If not, I'll explain: "primitive" (they also say "simple") means that this data type is not an object (we'll come back to this point) and does not have built-in methods of work (that is, functions‚öôÔ∏è).

![True](https://media.giphy.com/media/peBw21sPZnlqE/giphy.gif)

The data type that you will definitely need is called boolean, or boolean. Boolean type always has the value either `true` ‚úÖ - true, or` false` ‚ùé - false. And only this way, and nothing else! He is either lying or telling the truth - pan or disappear, the light is on or off, or there is or not. You either did your homework or you didn't. Only two 2Ô∏è‚É£ values are `true` ‚úÖ or` false`.

## Equality operators

Boolean values come in handy when we need to compare something in JavaScript. When the need arises, we immediately call the comparison operators.
Now we will sequentially study all eight comparison operators, but the thing is that as a result of each of them, we do not care
we will always be left with a boolean value - either `true` ‚úÖ or `false` ‚ùé.
