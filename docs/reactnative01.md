React Native is similar to React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks. To understand the basic structure of a Reactative application, you need to understand some basic React concepts such as JSX, components, state, and properties. If you're already familiar with React, you still need to learn some React Native-specific things, like native components. This tutorial is intended for any audience, whether you have experience with React or not.

## React Native Components

These are the building blocks of the `react-native` library from which we create the interface for applications.
Components allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable parts and with each of them separately.
Conceptually, components are similar to JavaScript functions.

## Function Components

The easiest way to declare a component is to write a JavaScript function:

```SnackPlayer name=index.js
import * as React from 'react'
import { Text } from 'react-native'

const App = () => (
  <Text>Hello world!</Text>
)

export default App
```
