Nesting navigators means displaying a navigator inside the screen of another navigator, for example:

```jsx
const Home = () => {
  return (
    <Tab.Navigator>
      <Tab.Screen name="Feed" component={Feed} />
      <Tab.Screen name="Messages" component={Messages} />
    </Tab.Navigator>
  )
}

const App = () => {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen
          name="Home"
          component={Home}
          options={{ headerShown: false }}
        />
        <Stack.Screen name="Profile" component={Profile} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Settings" component={Settings} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  )
}
```

In the above example, the `Home` component contains a tabbed navigator. The `Home` component is also used for the `Home` screen in your stack navigator inside the `App` component. So here's the tab navigator nested within the stack navigator:

- `Stack.Navigator`
  - `Home` (`Tab.Navigator`)
    - `Feed` (`Screen`)
    - `Messages` (`Screen`)
  - `Profile` (`Screen`)
  - `Settings` (`Screen`)

Nested navigators work the same way as regular components. To achieve the desired behavior, it is often necessary to nest multiple navigators.

## How nesting navs affects behavior

There are a few things to keep in mind when nesting navigators:

### Each navigator keeps its own navigation history.

For example, when you press the back button while on screen in a nested stack navigator, it will return to the previous screen inside the nested stack, even if there is another navigator as the parent.
