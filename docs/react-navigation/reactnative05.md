Now that we know how to customize the look and feel of our headers, let's make them smart! In fact, it might be ambitious, let's just give them the ability to react very clearly to our touch.

## Adding a button to the title

The most common way to interact with a heading is to click the button to the left or right of the heading. Let's add a button to the right side of the header (one of the hardest places to tap on the entire screen, depending on your finger and phone size, but also a normal place to place buttons).


```jsx
const StackScreen = () => {
  return (
    <Stack.Navigator>
      <Stack.Screen
        name="Home"
        component={HomeScreen}
        options={{
          headerTitle: props => <LogoTitle {...props} />,
          headerRight: () => (
            <Button
              onPress={() => alert('This is a button!')}
              title="Info"
              color="#fff"
            />
          ),
        }}
      />
    </Stack.Navigator>
  );
}
```

When we define our button in this way, the `this` variable in the `options` parameters is not an instance of `HomeScreen`, so you cannot call `setState` or any instance methods on it. This is very important because very often you want the buttons in your header to interact with the screen that the header belongs to. So, we'll see how to do this next.

## How a title interacts with its display component

To be able to interact with the screen component, we need to use `navigation.setOptions` to define our button instead of the `options` property. By using `navigation.setOptions` inside a screen component, we can access screen properties, state, context, etc.


```jsx
const StackScreen = () => {
  return (
    <Stack.Navigator>
      <Stack.Screen
        name="Home"
        component={HomeScreen}
        options={({ navigation, route }) => ({
          headerTitle: props => <LogoTitle {...props} />
        })}
      />
    </Stack.Navigator>
  )
}

const HomeScreen = ({ navigation }) => {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)

  React.useLayoutEffect(() => {
    navigation.setOptions({
      headerRight: () => (
        <Button onPress={() => setCount(c => c + 1)} title="Update count" />
      ),
    })
  }, [navigation])

  return <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
}
```
