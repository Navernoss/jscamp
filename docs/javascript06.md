In JavaScript, any text data is strings. However, do not forget that numbers can also be written in a string. Of all the data types, you will probably use strings the most. Let's analyze all the options for creating a new line.

## Single or double quotes

Either ‚Äòsingle‚Äô or ‚Äúdouble‚Äù quotes are used to create strings.

```jsx
let single = 'Hello World'
let double = "Hello World" // prettier-ignore
```

You can use both of them, the main thing is that if you start a line with a single one, although there may be doubles inside, it must also be completed with a single one. And, accordingly, with double quotes.

```jsx
let double = "Don't you think so, d'Artagnan?"
let single = '"I think so, indeed!" - cried he.'
```

## Backslash

If the same quotes are used inside the string as outside, then they must be escaped with a backslash - the so-called "escape character". It is appended ‚ûï before the enclosing quotation mark `\ '' so that it does not indicate the end of the line.

```jsx live
// prettier-ignore
function learnJavaScript() {
  let backticks = 'It\'s not complicated'
  return backticks
}
```

Note that the backslash `\` is only used to correctly read the string by the interpreter, but it is not written üñäÔ∏è to the string after it has been read. When a string is saved to main memory, the `\` character is not added to it. You can clearly see this in the findings.
