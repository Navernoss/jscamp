Components in React Native are styled using JavaScript. Color properties usually correspond to how CSS works on the web. General guidelines for using color on each platform can be found below:

- [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/)
- [Android](https://material.io/design/color/color-usage.html#hierarchy)

## Color representations

### Red Green Blue (RGB)

Red, green, blue  an additive color model that describes a way of coding a color for color reproduction using three colors, which are commonly called primary. The choice of primary colors is due to the physiological features of color perception by the retina of the human eye.
React Native supports `rgb()` and `rgba()` in both hexadecimal and functional notation:

- `'#f0f'` (#rgb)
- `'#ff00ff'` (#rrggbb)
- `'#f0ff'` (#rgba)
- `'#ff00ff00'` (#rrggbbaa)
- `'rgb(255, 0, 255)'`
- `'rgba(255, 0, 255, 1.0)'`

### Hue Saturation Lightness (HSL)

A color model in which the color coordinates are hue, saturation, and lightness.
React Native supports `hsl ()` and `hsla ()` in functional notation:

- `'hsl(360, 100%, 100%)'`
- `'hsla(360, 100%, 100%, 1.0)'`
