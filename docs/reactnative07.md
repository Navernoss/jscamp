## TextInput

`TextInput` - it is the main component that allows the user to enter text. It is the basic component for entering text into an application using the keyboard. Props provides customization options for several features such as autocorrect, auto-capitalization, placeholder text, and various keyboard types such as the numeric keypad. It has an `onChangeText` property that accepts a function called whenever the text changes, and a `onSubmitEditing` property that accepts a function called when the text is submitted. For now, ignore the `useState` hook, it is used to change the state of the application, we will get to know it more in the next series.

```SnackPlayer name=index.js
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { Text, TextInput, View } from 'react-native'

const PizzaTranslator = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState('')
  return (
    <View style={{padding: 10}}>
      <TextInput
        style={{height: 40}}
        placeholder="Введите здесь, чтобы перевести!"
        onChangeText={text => setText(text)}
        defaultValue={text}
      />
    </View>
  )
}

export default PizzaTranslator
```
