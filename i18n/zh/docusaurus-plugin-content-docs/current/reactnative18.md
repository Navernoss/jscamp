## Accessing the developer menu in the app

You can access the developer menu by shaking your device or by choosing Shake Gesture from the Hardware menu in the iOS simulator. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `âŒ˜D` when your application is running in the iOS simulator, or `âŒ˜M` when it is running in the Android emulator on Mac OS, and `Ctrl + M` on Windows and Linux. Alternatively for Android, you can run the command `adb shell input keyevent 82` to open the developer menu (82 is the menu key code).

> The developer menu is disabled in release (production) builds.

## Enabling Fast Refresh - Fast Refresh

`Fast Refresh` is a React Native feature that allows you to get almost instant feedback on changes to your React components. When debugging, it can be helpful to enable fast refresh. Fast Refresh is enabled by default, and you can toggle `Enable Fast Refresh` in the React Native developer menu. If enabled, most of your edits should be visible within a second or two.

## Enabling keyboard shortcuts

React Native supports several keyboard shortcuts in the iOS simulator. They are described below. To enable them, open the Hardware menu, select `Keyboard` and make sure the `Connect Hardware Keyboard` checkbox is checked.
