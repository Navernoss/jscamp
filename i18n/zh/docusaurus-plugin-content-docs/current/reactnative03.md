Most of the components can be customized when they are created with various parameters. These creation options are named - `props`.

Your own components can also use `props`. This allows you to create a single component that will be used in many different places in your application, with slightly different properties in each place. To get their values, refer to `props.YOUR_PROP_NAME` in your functional components or `this.props.YOUR_PROP_NAME` in your class components. 

Here's an example:

```SnackPlayer name=index.js
import * as React from 'react'
import { Text } from 'react-native'

const HelloWorld = (props) => (
  <Text>Hello world {props.name}!</Text>
)

const App = () => (
  <>
    <HelloWorld name='Luk' />
    <HelloWorld name='John' />
    <HelloWorld name='Ivan' />
  </>
)

export default App
```

Using `name` as `props` allows us to customize the greeting component so that we can reuse that component for each of our greetings. This example also uses the JSX `HelloWorld` component. The ability to do this is what makes React so awesome.
