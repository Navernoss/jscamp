We've already seen how to set the `title` in the Header, but let's take another look at that before moving on to some of the other options - repetition is the key to learning!

## Set up `title` in Header
The `Screen` component accepts an `options` option, which is either an object or a function that returns an object containing various configuration options. We use `title` as the title, as shown in the following example.

```jsx
const StackScreen = () => {
  return (
    <Stack.Navigator>
      <Stack.Screen
        name="Home"
        component={HomeScreen}
        options={{ title: 'My home' }}
      />
    </Stack.Navigator>
  )
}
```
